# mygithubproject

A new Flutter project that is being used to teach github platform basics

## Getting Started

In this tutorial, I will be teaching my kids about github platform.
Topics will be following:
    * How to upload a project onto github?
    * How to download a project from one computer to another?
    * How to work in teams using github?

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
